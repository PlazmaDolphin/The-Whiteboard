Objective: Kill all enemies (without getting killed yourself)

CLASSES:
1. The Stabber
    - Can kill only within melee distance
    - Kills all intercepted targets during turn
    - If no intercepts during turn, is on alert and can kill 1 target after turn
2. The Sniper
    - Targets 1 point in sight after moving
    - Everything from their position to that point is in-sight
    - If enemy moves in-sight (or is already in-sight), sniper shoots
    - Can only shoot once per round
3. The Hunter
    - Targets any enemy [in sight | on the field] at start of round
    - At beginning of turn, if enemy is in LOS, shoot them and halt
    - Otherwise, move to their position at the start of the round, scan area, then shoot if still there
    - Cannot kill anyone besides target
    - [Optional] Can kill target if in LOS anytime while moving
4. The Dummy
    - Cannot kill anyone
    - Will most definitely haul ass
    - Use him as cannon-fodder!
Thats enough classes for now


Who Kills Who?

Stabber vs. Sniper:
- If sniper runs into stabber, sniper dies
- If stabber crosses sniper's sights (even if in melee range), stabber dies
- If same turn, sniper dies
Stabber vs. Hunter:
- If stabber is hunter's target and in melee range, both die
- If stabber is not hunter's target, hunter dies, stabber lives
Stabber vs. Stabber:
- Stabber whose turn it is (even if other is on alert)
- If both stabbers' turns, both die
Sniper vs. Sniper:
- Whoever went first
- If both have same turn, both die
Hunter vs. Sniper:
- If hunter goes last and shoots sniper while in sniper's sights, hunter dies, sniper lives
- If both go simultaneously, sniper dies, hunter lives
Hunter vs. Hunter:
- Whoever's turn it is
- If both's turn, both die
- If not the target, will not die
Anyone vs. Dummy:

If 2 units run into each other but don't kill each other, movement halts at that point
Snipers will [not have a sight | look at the original point, but from that halted position]
